# JavaScript and TypeScript Support

This release of Reactr includes a new library for use with JavaScript and TypeScript runnables. With Subo Beta-4, JS runnables can be created with `subo create runnable <name> --lang js`, and TS runnables can be created with `subo create runnable <name> --lang ts`.
